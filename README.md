Délicat Foodbook was created to provide the user with recipes in seconds. With our filterable searchbar, you can look up recipes based on ingredient (oregano, chicken, sugar), cuisine (asian, mexican), or time of day (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

We have implemented a registraion form on the homepage that allows the user to sign up for future notifications, ensuring that they're always informed on when we add new recipes to the website.


Our website is warm and inviting, including colours that instill hunger in the users; we need you to be hungry for these delicious meals we have for you. Hover effects on the links invites the users to explore. We have interesting images to catch and keep the users eye.
